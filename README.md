# Virtual_Dog_Game
This is a a little virtual dog game I made when trying to practice my Java skills (a quick way to keep myself refreshed). I had so much fun, and I know it's not a perfect project - I mean it's stuck in the command-line - but hey, I;m happy with it. The dog's needs will get randomised as you play, and if you try to do too many actions over and over again, the dog will get annoyed! Have fun looking after your doggo! üê∂
